# Habitude #
> Keeping yourself accountable through community.

## Habitude ##
> Habitude is a social network site for users that want to learn and build new habits in their daily lives. Studies show that working out with another person leads to greater motivation to continue with the habit. Habitude makes the job a easier and more fun through the power of the social network.

## The Benefits ##
> Habitude is for anyone that wants to be a part of community everywhere they as they adopt new habits in their daily lives. 

## What is Habitude? ##
> Habitude uses the power of social motivatation to encourage users to continue practicing a daily habit. Our community of "habituders" are here to encourage and uplift one another.

## Problem ##
> Adopting new habits is never easy. Finding the motivation to go the gym more often, eating better, or not watching TV before going to bed is easily forgotten in our busy lives. In addition, not seeing visible progress in adopting new habits often chips away at the little motivation we have to persist and develop.

## Solution ##
> [Studies](http://psychcentral.com/news/2012/05/30/exercising-with-a-partner-boosts-motivation/39421.html) show that working out with another person leads to greater motivation to continue with the habit. Habitude allows users to add a habit and connect with other users who are also working towards adopting new habits. Users can provide daily updates, keeping other "habituders" informed on their progress. The power of Habitude lies in the ability of the Habitude community to give "kudos" to users when a habit is practiced, thus increasing motivation, chances of success and overall fun!
